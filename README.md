### 🔧 About Me  

I am a software engineer with a strong foundation in **C/C++**, **embedded systems**, and **real-time firmware**.  
My experience spans **STM32**, **sensor integration**, **reliable device control**, and **low-level system behavior**.

Recently, I’ve been expanding my work into areas that combine embedded engineering with  
**systems performance, virtualization tooling, and cloud-scale reliability**—fields that connect  
hardware, operating systems, and large-scale infrastructure.

My focus areas include:

- Real-time firmware on STM32 (H7 series)  
- Deterministic communication, watchdog recovery, persistent storage  
- Linux SBC experiments (Orange Pi, Raspberry Pi)  
- QEMU/TCE exploration for system instrumentation  
- High-quality C/C++ architecture & fault-tolerant design  
- Continuous learning in systems performance & cloud-native reliability  

I enjoy working on complex technical problems where correctness, performance, and reliability matter.

I’m excited by the intersection of **low-level engineering + large-scale systems**, and I bring a strong problem-solving mindset to environments where performance and reliability matter.
